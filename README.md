# Survival-Of-The-Fittest

Developed by GameBros for a University of Canterbury project.

Evolution is the only way forward â€“ Survival of the Fittest is a 2D Real-Time Strategy/Battle Simulator that challenges you to evolve your species to dominate your opposition and become the strongest life force on the planet. 
Impactful evolutionary choices determine the traits of your creatures and the method of defeating your foes.
Will you evolve to counter your weaknesses, or empower your strengths? 
These choices will determine if you rise to power or succumb to history.
